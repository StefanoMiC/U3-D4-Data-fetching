// 1) We are going to create an empty state, for holding the reservations list at a later point
// 2) We are going to bind between UI and STATE, and so the INTERFACE will be updated automatically by the render() method
// 3) Now it's time to fill up the STATE! We are going to fetch the reservations list and use this.setState() to put them into the state
// 4) We shouldn't launch our fetchReservations() function from render().... because render() fires again every time the setState is used
// 5) we should find a method that is GUARANTEED to execute ONLY ONCE!
// 6) and that method is called componentDidMount, and if present, will be executed after the initial render() invokation!

// - first render invocation takes into the page the static elements: the tile, an empty list, the side components etc...
// - after the first render, componentDidMount gets executed AUTOMATICALLY (if one is present)
// - componentDidMount takes care of executing the fetch() for us, because it's guaranteed to NOT be executed again!
// - after getting the data from the API, componentDidMount usually sets the state with the data (not re-triggered by the setState)
// - after setting the state, the render() method wakes up again AUTOMATICALLY and fires again.
// This time evaluates what's changed in the UI (thanks to the VIRTUAL DOM) and updates only that piece of information that requires changing.
